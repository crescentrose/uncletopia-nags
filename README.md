# SourceMod Plugin Template

This is a simple template that provides a reasonable directory structure for a
SourceMod plugin, as well as a `Makefile` that enables easy SourceMod
compilation and release management.

Remember to:

- [ ] rename `src/plugin.sp` to the name of your plugin/s
- [ ] generate configs and translations in `config/sourcemod` and `config/translations` respectively
- [ ] add plugin details to your plugin
- [ ] have fun and be yourself
